Navigate to the root directory of the project (The one this file is in) and type:

python main.py

This will launch the program and overwrite the ssl.txt logfile with new results. If you would like to change the test, change the TESTNUM in constant.py  to another number. The numbers correspond to the index of CAFILE array in the same file.

The malicious file (CA3.txt") is located at index 2 currently.
